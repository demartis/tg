Description: Program for timing mechanincal watches
 Tg (tg-timer) is a program to evaluate the performance of mechanical watch
 movements. Tg works with the noise produced by a watch mechanism, and it
 produces real-time readings of the rate (or accuracy) and various other
 operational parameters.
